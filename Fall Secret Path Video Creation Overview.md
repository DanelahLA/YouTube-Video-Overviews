#### Path Section 0 - Intro

* Show location on map
* Navigate to the Daily UI for Fall Secret Path Area Operation and flash the description / rewards.
* Can use this section to add any additional intro information.
	* Area Operations have reduced durability
	* Missions are the best value for your time outside of basically Trap Boss
	*
* Could have a little intro blurb on mission Videos about group etiquette? Bring bandages, serums, food, antiserum, apply buffs, ammo boxes, helms for harder content
* Could have a little section of the video showing you applying all your buffs. etc.


#### Path Section 1 - Entering the Forest (Complete for C Rating)
PSS - Amino Acid (Green) Sedative (Yellow) Hardener (Blue)
Enemies of note: Life Suckers, Infected and Rebirth (flying monster)
Screen Info: Start with 1, split to 2 (1 from group of 3, 1 from runner)

* The Sniper Icon indicates a target is best suited for sniping. (?)
* Clear the 3 Life Suckers as a team. 
* Wave 1: 
	* 3 People clear the right and left of the first wave while one person is the Runner.
	* Runner runs and starts the generator.
* Wave 2: 
	* Runner runs back to the front of the truck throwing down a yellow serum in the same location. By the time all of the zombies reach the yellow in one big group, the 		other 3 will there ready to bring a swift end to these pour zombie souls.
* Rebirth (Boss):
	* 3 People take out the bosss. 
	* Runner restarts the generator. Rebirth needs to be dead before the detonation or you'll have to restart the generator. 
* Refill health & shields, ammo, unequip your weapon and eat speed food


#### Path Section 2 - Run, Gun & Slide
PSS - Amino Acid (Green) Sedative (Yellow) Hardener (Blue)
Enemies of note: Screaming Infected and Parasitic Infected/Abomination
Screen Info: 1 from team, maybe 4 going down the path?

* Parasitic Infected: Must be meleed off by your teammates. You CAN run and shoot while one is attached to you
* Option 1: (More Mastery, Takes away from End-Time)
	* Can kill the zombies as you go through and collect the ammo box and meet up at the objective circle, Open the gate to slide
* Option 2: (Less Mastory, Less Time)
	* Run along the path as a group to the objective circle, avoiding the Parasitic Infected, Take care of Parasites or Zombies as needed if you have a slower team member 	until you are able to open the gate to slide
* Option 3: (More Mastory, More Time)
	* Follow Option 2 until the objective circle, throw down a Sedative slay another unfortunate horde of zombies and open the gate to slide
	
* On the slide down you can showcase how far up you can go on the sides, can mention that if you go behind the monsters, they wont grab you. And that the blue goo will slow you.
* Apparently its also possible to do a front flip at the end of the slide? Ask BFire how this works, be figured it out, I think you just swipe up at the end or something.


#### Path Section 3 - The Road to the Cammander (Complete for B Rating)
PSS - T-Hormone (Red), Amino Acid (Green), Hardener (Blue)
Enemies of Note: Devourer Beetles and Infected
Screen Info: 1 from team, if a beetle attacks-add that viewpoint?, if someone falls off truck-add that viewpoint?

* On the landing of the slide, I like to land to the left, so that the building stops my forward movement quicker, I then quickly throw a yellow serum at the convergence point between the two groups, and do more work. -Z
* You'll drop down into a wave of infected. You can rally with the NPC's inside the barricade circle or eliminate them from where you drop (as my character is short, it's easier for me to do the latter). -D
* Once the wave is dead, reload your ammo from the free box in the barricade and take care of your health. Talk to the captain and follow him to the truck.
* There are Beetles on the path, so try to hit those before they land on you. Position yourself so your team mates can shoot it off if you get one. Comment about bug locations, seems like usually 3-4 when I run, but not always in the same spots, one spawn left, one spawn right, two spawns in front of the truck.
* Jump up on the truck, reload from the free ammo box, start the truck and jump up on top of the cab, which is the safest spot to be.
* Mention that serums can now be thrown on the truck, and therefor utilized, where in the past they would go through the truck and onto the ground, not as useful.
* The objective here is to keep the truck safe, so kill the infected that attack the truck first, the rest aren't as important.
* Before you enter the gate or jump off the truck into the next area, you'll want to reload your ammo.

#### Path Section 4 - Red Light, Green Light: Boss Fight (Completion Rating based on Time)
PSS - T-Hormone (Red), Amino Acid (Green), Hardener (Blue)
Enemies of Note: The Commander 
Screen Info: 1 to 4, idk

* Z's Info: 
	* Spread out and surround the boss from all angles.
	* A super boss group would throw down 4 reds creating a ring of death around the boss for the first 50%, because he doesnt really move at all.
	* mention that you must close, I believe, 3 eyes to inturrpt the boss during his special. Which is why the tight surround is important.
	* If he charges you dodge.
	* When he goes into berserk mode, cant move. (cant shoot? how do I not remember this?).
	* Avoid the blue goo on the ground.
	* For beginners you can use the surrounding junk to get away from the boss /avoid charges etc.

* D's Info:
	* This is the end of the path. You'll be fighting the Commander, head shots and hitting the top of his stoplight staff are best. 
 	* Keep an eye on the middle of the screen where his health bar is. Just below that is a stoplight, and it will change from green to yellow you'll need to get ready to freeze in place. This is a classic game of red light green light, where red means stop and green means go.
	* The Commander will jump in your face during the red light, which will bring your Health down. It's safe to take Advanced Antiseptic, use a Med Kit and throw Diffusers. 
	* When you eliminate the Commander, refill your ammo (reduced cost), grab your loot box, talk to the Captain and exit by helicopter. 

#### Path Section 5 - Outro
* Something about using the FF Feat points
	* What you usually buy
	* The fact that you're typically using yesterdays Feat Points, since todays are sitting in the mailbox, and going to get them and coming back is inefficient.
	* Missions are the most efficient way to max loot from an area each day.
