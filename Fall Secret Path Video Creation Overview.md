### Content

Definitions:
PSS - Primary Serum Suggestions

#### Path Section 0 - Intro

* Show location on map
* Navigate to the Daily UI for Fall Secret Path Area Operation and flash the description / rewards.
* Can use this section to add any additional intro information.
	* Area Operations have reduced durability
	* Missions are the best value for your time outside of basically Trap Boss
	*
* Could have a little intro blurb on mission Videos about group etiquette? Bring bandages, serums, food, antiserum, apply buffs, ammo boxes, helms for harder content
* Could have a little section of the video showing you applying all your buffs. etc.


#### Path Section 1 - Start and Boss #1
PSS - Yellow, Blue

* The Sniper Icon indicates a target is best suited for sniping.
* 3 People clear the right and left while one person is the Runner.
* Runner runs and starts the box, then runs back to the front of the truck throwing down a yellow serum in the same location. By the time all of the zombies reach the yellow in one big group, the other 3 will there ready to bring a swift end to these pour zombie souls.
* Murder boss. I'm sure one person could be opening the objective while the boss is being killed, but I've never tried, or attempted to organize that.
* Would mention that this is a good short window of time for stacking heal/shield serums on the objective, and using any other means to heal up quickly as to not slow down the group.

#### Path Section 2 - Run & Gun, Slide 
PSS - Yellow, Blue

* Can kill the zombies as you go through and collect the ammo box (beginner), or can run along the right as a group, throw down a yellow right in front of the objective circle, and slay another unfortunate horde of zombies (or skip all together? and miss combat xp I guess?)
* On the slide down you can showcase how far up you can go on the sides, can mention that if you go behind the monsters, they wont grab you. And that the blue goo will slow you.
* On the landing of the slide, I like to land to the left, so that the building stops my forward movement quicker, I then quickly throw a yellow serum at the convergence point between the two groups, and do more work.
* Apparently its also possible to do a front flip at the end of the slide? Ask BFire how this works, be figured it out, I think you just swipe up at the end or something.


#### Path Section 3 - Save NPCs, Truck Escort
PSS - Red, Blue, Green

* Point out the ammo box next to the NPCs in the protective ring of barricades.
* Comment about bug locations, seems like usually 3-4 when I run, but not always in the same spots, one spawn left, one spawn right, two spawns in front of the truck.
* After starting the truck, mention that serums can now be thrown on the truck, and therefor utilized, where in the past they would go through the truck and onto the ground, not as useful.

#### Path Section 4 - Boss fight
PSS - Red, Blue, Green

* Spread out and surround the boss from all angles.
* A super boss group would throw down 4 reds creating a ring of death around the boss for the first 50%, because he doesnt really move at all.
* mention that you must close, I believe, 3 eyes to inturrpt the boss during his special. Which is why the tight surround is important.
* If he charges you dodge.
* When he goes into berserk mode, cant move. (cant shoot? how do I not remember this?).
* Avoid the blue goo on the ground.
* For beginners you can use the surrounding junk to get away from the boss /avoid charges etc.


#### Path Section 5 - Outro
* Something about using the FF Feat points
	* What you usually buy
	* The fact that you're typically using yesterdays Feat Points, since todays are sitting in the mailbox, and going to get them and coming back is inefficient.
	* Missions are the most efficient way to max loot from an area each day.
